	abstract = {This paper proposes a neural network approach for forecasting short-term electricity prices. Almost until the end of last century, electricity supply was considered a public service and any price forecasting which was undertaken tended to be over the longer term, concerning future fuel prices and technical improvements. Nowadays, short-term forecasts have become increasingly important since the rise of the competitive electricity markets. In this new competitive framework, short-term price forecasting is required by producers and consumers to derive their bidding strategies to the electricity market. Accurate forecasting tools are essential for producers to maximize their profits, avowing profit losses over the misjudgement of future price movements, and for consumers to maximize their utilities. A three-layered feedforward neural network, trained by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, is used for forecasting next-week electricity prices. We evaluate the accuracy of the price forecasting attained with the proposed neural network approach, reporting the results from the electricity markets of mainland Spain and California.}

The study uses gross domestic product, average price of electricity and population of New Zealand during the period 1965–1999. Models are developed using multiple linear regression analysis. It was found that the electricity consumption correlated effectively with all variables. Forecasts made using these models were compared with some available national forecasts. The forecasts are also compared with the forecasts of the previously developed Logistic model.}

	abstract = {Different ways to evaluate the building energy balance can be found in literature, including comprehensive techniques, statistical and machine-learning methods and hybrid approaches. The identification of the most suitable approach is important to accelerate the preliminary energy assessment. In the first category, several numerical methods have been developed and implemented in specialised software using different mathematical languages. However, these tools require an expert user and a model calibration. The authors, in order to overcome these limitations, have developed an alternative, reliable linear regression model to determine building energy needs. Starting from a detailed and calibrated dynamic model, it was possible to implement a parametric simulation that solves the energy performance of 195 scenarios. The lack of general results led the authors to investigate a statistical method also capable of supporting an unskilled user in the estimation of the building energy demand. To guarantee high reliability and ease of use, a selection of the most suitable variables was conducted by careful sensitivity analysis using the Pearson coefficient. The Multiple Linear Regression method allowed the development of some simple relationships to determine the thermal heating or cooling energy demand of a generic building as a function of only a few, well-known parameters. Deep statistical analysis of the main error indices underlined the high reliability of the results. This approach is not targeted at replacing a dynamic simulation model, but it represents a simple decision support tool for the preliminary assessment of the energy demand related to any building and any weather condition.}

	abstract = {Medium-term electric energy demand forecasting is a useful tool for grid maintenance planning and market research of electric energy companies. Several methods, such as ARIMA, regression or artificial intelligence, have been usually used to carry out those predictions. Some approaches include weather or economic variables, which strongly influence electric energy demand. Economic variables usually influence the general series trend, while weather provides a periodic behavior because of its seasonal nature. This work investigates the periodic behavior of the Spanish monthly electric demand series, obtained by rejecting the trend from the consumption series. A novel hybrid approach is proposed: the periodic behavior is forecasted with a Fourier series while the trend is predicted with a neural network. Satisfactory results have been obtained, with a lower than 2% MAPE, which improve those reached when only neural networks or ARIMA were used for the same purpose.}
